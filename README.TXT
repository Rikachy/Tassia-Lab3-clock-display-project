Project: clock-display
Authors: David Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 3.

To use this project, create an instance of class ClockDisplay. Then inspect this 
instance and leave the object inspector window open. With the inspector window open, 
call the object's methods, such as timeTick and setTime. Watch the 
"displayString" in the inspector.

The displayString field simulates the actual clock display device. Were this 
program running in a real clock, it would change the real, physical display 
hardware instead of this string. The timeTick method would be triggered once 
every minute by some timer hardware.

Everything else could be pretty much the same.


Note: This project does not implement adequate handling of errors.

Question 20.
The first one would you 12cat, because the numbers are found in the front.
The second one would give you cat39, becaue the code would read it as a sting.
Since the cat is placed first.

Question 21. 
The default time has been set to 00:00

Question 23. 
You would need to call the timeTick 60 times, or use the setTime method. 

Question 24. 

NumberDisplay digit;

NumberDisplay digit = new NumberDisplay(10);

Question 25.
Rectangle window
window = new Rectangle (int length, int width)

Question 26.
It makes it so you can set a specific time. 

Question 27. 
The second has parameters : int min and int h. 
The second constructor has the call to setTime which acts like the updateDisplay.

Question 28. 
public void print(String filename, boolean doubleSided){
   this.doubleSided = doubleSided
   if (doubleSided){
   System.out.println ("this" + filename)}
   
else{
System.out.println ("this" + filename)}
}

public int getStatus(int delay){
this.delay = delay
System.out.println("Package will arrive in" + delay)
}

Question 29. 
Shapes 

Question 30.
